# bin
None of these scripts are made by me. I have gathered them from across the internet and editted them to my liking. Some of them work in conjunction with my own scripts that can be found in the `bin` repository.

**install.sh** system settings that I prefer

**appify** converts shell scripts into MacOS .apps

**movgif** converts .mov into .gif

**upload** uploads to 0x0.st

**upscr** uploads a screenshot using `scr` and sends a notification when finished

**lastfm** notifies on new scrobble

**enju** hard-coded system info script
